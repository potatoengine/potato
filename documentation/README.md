Potato Engine
=============

Synopsis
--------

Potato Engine is a hobby project by a few friends and former coworkers. It is mostly an experimentation ground and not intended for any serious work.

The goals of the code base are:
- Be a reasonable ground for experimenting with modern rendering techniques
- Be an exemplar of modern C++
- Be an exemplar of what game tooling can accomplish

If you're asking "why should I use this?" the answer is "you shouldn't." :)
