# readability-qualified-auto is often "wrong" because we use raw pointers as iterators
# readability-magic-numbers is just annoying for math-heavy code, though it is valuable elsewhere
# readability-upper-literal-suffix is just stylistically objectionable, e.g. 1.2f vs 1.2F
# readability-convert-member-functions-to-static has side effects (e.g. calling conventions)
# readability-named-parmater TODO consider adding this back
